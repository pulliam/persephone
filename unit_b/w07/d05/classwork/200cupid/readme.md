# 200 Cupid!

## The story thus far...

-[] We've created a Sinatra Application with a SQLite3 database for persistence.

-[] We've implemented Users and Sessions to provide logins.

-[] We've implemented bcrypt and added password_digest to our user model
to provide a level of security and authentication.

# Next Steps

- We'll prepare our app for a wider audience
- We'll abstract our database schema with migrations
- We'll configure our app for development and production
- We'll deploy to Heroku.
