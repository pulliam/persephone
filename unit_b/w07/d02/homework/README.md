![be prepaaaarred](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/8c/57/4b/8c574bd9be569bdf85b3a45a8877f91b.gif)

Your assignment is to prepare yourself to get started on your second project! Tonight, complete the following tasks:

#### ActiveRecord Associations

- Read through the [ActiveRecord association basics](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html).
- Finish the activities assigned this afternoon (Many to Many exercises).

#### Prepare for Project Two

- Read through the project two readme and look over the individual project prompts (forum and wiki).
- Choose which prompt you'd like to tackle for this sprint.
- Start thinking about how your application will function and how you'll model your data.
- Think about the domain model for your project.
- Create an ERD that includes the entities and relationships that you anticipate your application will use. This should be completed by tomorrow morning - you'll present this to an instructor when you have your 5-minute project pitch.

### Deliverables

By 9:00 AM tomorrow, you should have the following items completed:

- ERD file
- schema.sql file
- A new Github repo for your project with your instructors added as collaborators.
- File structure of your application set up in this repo.
