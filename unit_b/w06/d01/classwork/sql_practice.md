### SQL Practice!

- Recreate this table in a new sqlite3 database file. Each entry should receive a primary key automatically.

### Write Some Queries

- Create a new `classwork.sql` file.

You'll be working in the `sqlite3` command line program, but **you'll be saving these commands for reference inside your `classwork.sql` file**. Once you've written a command that works, copy and paste it into your classwork file. *(Better yet, write it out again! Reps reps reps)*

Open up your database in the `sqlite3` command line program and write queries to...

1. Find Dana's age.
- Find Johnny's favorite food and age.
- Find Doug's favorite TV show.
- Find out Anusha's age and favorite TV show.
- Find out EVERYTHING about Frances.
- Change Anastasia's favorite show to "Roseanne".
- Change Isabel's favorite food to Steak and Eggs.
- Change De's favorite food to coq au vin.
- Change Chris's favorite food to kale and favorite tv show to "Good Morning America".
- Change Alex's age to 65 and favorite food to steamed broccoli.
- Delete Emily.
- Delete Jess.
- Delete Bennett.
