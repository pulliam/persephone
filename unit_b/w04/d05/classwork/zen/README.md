# CSS Zen Garden

## Your Mission

Today, you'll be participating in the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) project!

CSS Zen Garden is "a demonstration of what can be accomplished through CSS-based design." The objective is to take an existing HTML document and, without changing any of the markup, create an aesthetically pleasing page with a distinct look and feel. It's a great illustration of the separation between style and structure.

### Objectives

1. **Style** elements on your page using tag names, classes and ids.
- Practice **positioning** elements on different parts of the page.
- Challenge yourself by styling a document another developer created **without** modifying their HTML.

### Getting Started

It's a good (read: vital) idea to know where you're going before you start writing code. Look at your HTML document to get an idea of how it's **structured**. Take a few minutes to draw out your design before you create any CSS.

If you're feeling creatively blocked, take five-to-ten minutes to look over the [example gallery](http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/). ***NOTE:*** These all made it into the showcase, and are all pretty complex designs - don't try to reproduce a page's entire look for this exercise. Pick out things you feel that you can accomplish - positioning, styling - and tackle them one-by-one. **Think of this as a sketch, or a first pass.** Keep it simple at first, then elaborate later.

Note this line in the provided HTML file: `34  - use classes for styling. Don't use ids.` *Why might we want/not want to use an element's ID when applying CSS styles?*

## Further Resources

- **[CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/)** - A fun little game that'll help you learn to write **CSS selectors**, from the most basic up to more advanced. I suggest going up to at least level 11!
- **CSS Positioning** - One of the most misunderstood aspects of CSS styling. If you're having CSS positioning difficulties, check out these guides to the different types:
    - [A List Apart: CSS Positioning 101](http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101) - fantastic, thorough walkthrough with simple, well-explained examples. Also check out their [article on floats](http://alistapart.com/article/css-floats-101).
    - [CSS Tricks Positioning](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/position) - concise and to-the-point, with examples.
    - [BarelyFitz's CSS Positioning in Ten Steps](http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/) - short and sweet, good step-by-step visuals. Also touches on floats & clear.


<!-- Note to self - this can be tackled later, as a separate exercise. Preferably after they play with CSS Diner. -->

<!-- ### CSS Pseudo-Classes

Yesterday, you got a little taste of pseudo-classes with the `input:checked` CSS selector. `:checked` is what's known as a [psuedo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes), or a CSS selector that refers to an element in a specific state. Here's an example of a CSS rule applied to a psuedo-class:

```css
a:visited {
  margin: 35px;
}
```

A few more to play with:

- `:hover`
- `:first-child`
- `:nth-of-type()`
- `:not()`

Make sure you check out the MDN docs on [psuedo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) for information and specific examples! -->
