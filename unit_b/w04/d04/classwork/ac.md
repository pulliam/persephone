# Air Conditioner

You've been tasked with writing a simple program that asks the user for the
current temperature and the desired temperature, and whether or the not the A/C
is on.

Depending on the user's inputs, print an appropriate response.

Sample Interaction
```
> "The AC is ON and 72 degrees"
> "Would you like to change the temperature? (yes/no)"
$ yes
> "What would you like to change it to?"
$ 78
> "OK!"
> "Turn AC off? (yes/no)"
> "The current temp is 78 degrees"
```

```
> "Would you like to change the temperature? (yes/no)"
$ hotdogs
> "I don't think I understand"
```
