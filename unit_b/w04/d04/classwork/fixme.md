# Fix me

Take a look at the Ruby program `fixme.md`

It's supposed to print out 

```
"Hello Jimmy Lazers."
```

Instead it's formatting is wonky

```
Hello Jimmy
 Lazers
.
```

Can you search Ruby's string docs to find out how to programmatically remove 
carriage returns and new lines?

After that how can you programatically fix the next error?

Can you update the "What's the rush" string to include "it's only (whatever today's date is)"

Can you update the "Time's wasting!" string to say "Where's that novel?! I wanted it (one day before today)"
