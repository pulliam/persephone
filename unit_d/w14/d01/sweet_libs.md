# It's _Sweet Libs_ time!

Sweet libs is an opportunity to test your ability to pick up new technology without someone walking you through it. You will have the day to read the docs, practice writing code, and work to understand how and why someone would use a specific library/framework.

### For this project you will be:

* Working in small groups to research a topic that you know little to nothing about. 
* Creating a self-guided tutorial.
* Teaching the topic to the class.

### Timeline

You will have from right now until today at 4 PM to work with your group. At 4, presentations will start. Each group will have 20 minutes to present.

### Expectations

##### Quick start guide

Each group needs to create a "getting started" tutorial on their topic. It should be:

  - Written in markdown and on a Github Repo
  - You should include screen shots, gifs, diagrams, or other tools that will help make the guide as useful as possible (but don't waste time on styling, this project is about content, not style).
  - You should look to the offical docs/start guides for inspiration, but make yours more approachable for WDI students. Think about what assumed knowledge is in the offical docs, and unassume it. Fill in the missing pieces.
  - Make sure to note dependencies, and similarities/differences to other types of tech we've studied.
  - Any code files that are needed should be included in this repo. This includes Gemfiles or package.json!

##### An app

Every group must have a repository for their tutorial/app hosted on Github.

- The Flask group must demonstrate a simple "Hello World" server written in Python that also serves up CSS and JavaScript and serves at least one dynamic route (accepts URL parameters). They should describe the steps necessary to install Python and get the simple server up and running.
- The Wordpress group needs to make blog with a separate home page that uses a theme, a child theme (customized), and at least one plug-in.
- The Ember, React, and Backbone groups need to create a single page application (no server-side) that has a form for collecting data into a list of rows and columns. The user should be able to sort the collection by clicking on the column headers. You do not need to persist data.
- The Gulp group needs to show how Gulp can be used to **watch** files for changes, concatenate scripts, pre-process files, and minify/uglify code. They need to create a sample Express app and demonstrate how to use Gulp tasks to automate application setup and pre-process SASS files.
- The D3 group should create a webpage that presents data in a bar graph, line graph, and one additional format. Their presentation should include an explanation of what D3 does and a walkthrough of how to get started.

##### Presentation

Each group needs to prepare a presentation where they walk the rest of the class through the basics of the library/framework, demo the app they made, and talk about what use cases the tech has. 

- Why would someone choose to use your group's tech? You should be prepared to answer questions from the class - and when you are in the audience, ask questions of the other groups. 
- You should feel free to use whatever teaching techniques you'd like! Make to to make your presentations interesting and engaging, as everyone has to sit through them :)
- Talk about what hurdles there were with the documentation, what knowledge was assumed, and what you had to research.
