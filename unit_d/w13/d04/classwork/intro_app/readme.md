# Intro to Angular


Install angular via bower

```
$ bower install angular
```

Link angular.js to the index.html file

Add an h1 tag to index.html that says "hello"

We're going to work first with static html files and then later serve these
via express. We can use python's Simple Http Server before we write our own backend.

Run this from inside `intro_app`

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

Then navigate your browser to localhost:3000

ooooh
