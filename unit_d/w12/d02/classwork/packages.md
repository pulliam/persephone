# NPM and Packages

Read through this documentation from NPM https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json and answer the following questions:

- What does a package.json file do?
- What does a pakcage.json file require?
- What happens when you run "npm init"?
- How do you skip all of npm init's questions?
- What do "--save" and "--save-dev" do?

After answering the above questions, create a new package.json file inside of "scraper_activity" and install "request" and "cheerio" as dependencies and "jasmine" as a "devDependency"
