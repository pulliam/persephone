# NVM, NPM, Node

Because we have more control over where our JavaScript will run, we can manage the particular version of Node that our code will require.

NVM is the Node Version Manager, which allows us to use different version of Node for different projects on our machines.

Given what you know about command line tools...

- Can you find the help info "nvm", "npm" and "node"
- What versions of each are you running?
