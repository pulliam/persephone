# Client-Side vs Server-Side Requests and Rendering in JavaScript

Earlier this week we used Request.js to make HTTP requests in Node. Now that we
have Express as a server we can send static and dynamic assets to our clients.

Today we'll revisit Ajax to make requests on the client side.

Objectives
- Perform Asynchronous Requests to the Server via JavaScript
- Perform client-side templating with JavaScript

Agenda

- ajax.md
- ajax_app
- intro-to-bower.md
- intro-to-handlebars.md
- empire_app
- titanic_lab
