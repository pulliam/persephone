Create a button on "index" that performs an Ajax request to "/black_squadron" and returns the JSON of black_squadron data

Once the client has received the response, render it to the page using Handlebars templating.

# Bonus

jQuery and Handlebars have been added to "index.ejs" via CDNs. Can you read "intro-to-bower" and install jQuery and Handlebars using `bower`?
