***Welcome back!***

### Instructions:

- Split into groups of 2-3 students. Say hi, it's been a while! You'll be assigned one of the following questions by your instructor, which your group will research and present on.
- Take 15 - 20 minutes to discuss & research your topic as a group. Your instructor will give you a 5-minute warning.
- One at a time, each group will come up to the board and whiteboard/discuss their chosen topic. **Each member of the group must take part.**


### Topics:

1. Diagram the essential parts of a web server as we've created them in class so far. Include as many parts as you can.
1. What is the purpose of a database? What problem does it solve for us? How have we interacted with our databases so far?
1. What is AJAX? What is its purpose - why would we use it? How does it work?
1. What is usually meant by a 3rd party API? How do we get information from an API? How do we use/hide API keys?
1. Outline the general flow of the HTTP Request/Response Cycle. What happens when a server responds with a 200? A 404? A 302?
1. Why have our servers needed to be restarted after we change the server code? Do we have to restart our Rails applications when we change the server code? Why or why not?
1. What is JSON? Why is it useful/where have you seen it used? Write out an example of a JSON file. How could a Ruby or JavaScript program interact with this data?
1. You're creating a database of Star-Wars-related information for your latest client. What are the steps you'd need to take to set up this database, using only SQL (no Rails)? Write out the SQL queries to retrieve the following info from your imaginary database: a) All of the ewoks in your database, b) Princess Leia's record, and c) All jedi older than 25 and younger than 50.
