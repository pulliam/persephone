# Happy Holidays!

You've opened presents, slepted in, watched Star Wars and gotten drunk with your high school friends.

# NOW WHAT?!

In order to keep your coding chops sharpened we've included some "optional" (strongly suggested) assignments to work on.

There are 5 assignments, so you can do one a day and treat them like morning exericses.

Two assignemnts (Forest Fire and Holiday Keyboard) are challenges to work with jQuery and Events.

The other three are introductions to testing and test driven development. There are tests or "specs" already written and it'll be up to you to write the code to make those tests pass.

See you next year!

xoxo

Sung, Phil and Anna.
