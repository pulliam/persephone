# WDI Persephone Class Repository

![persephone_logo](./img/persephone.png)

This will be your shared class repo! Guides, in-class labs and code
samples, and other resources will live here.

Welcome to the WDI Persephone class repository. This is where
we will store the information you need as students. This includes important
links and readings, in-class examples, exercises, labs, homework and projects.

<!--In order to submit your homework to this repo and share it with your
instructional team and classmates, please follow the
**[Homework Submission Process](homework_submission_process.md)**

## Course Outline

Below is a general outline of the course content. See the README for each week for a more thorough syllabus.

Keep in mind, this is tentative. **We may (and shall) change topics and dates as necessary.**


| Unit     |    Topic    |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| **A**  | [Problem Solving & Front-end Fundamentals](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-persephone/tree/master/unit_a)         |
| **B**  | [Full-stack Development with Ruby/Rails & Databases](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-persephone/tree/master/unit_b)        |
| **C**  | [Full-stack Development with JS/Node](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-persephone/tree/master/unit_c)               |
| **D**  | [MV* Front-end Frameworks](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-persephone/tree/master/unit_d) |

## Repo Structure and Use

#### What's in here?

```
/wdi-persephone
    /guides
    /projects
    /unit_a
        /w01
            /d01
                /classwork
                /homework
                /instructor
            ...
        ...
    /unit_b
    /unit_c
    /unit_d
```

- The **unit** directories help us organize our work into themes.
    - each Weekly / Daily directories (**w01/d01**) contains
          - a **classwork** directory where you can put your class work.
          - a **homework** directory where you will find prompts and can work on your homework and labs.
          - a **instructor** directory where in-class code samples will go. Please do not work in this folder. Copy and paste the files into classwork, homework, or elsewhere first.
- The **guides** directory will be your go-to for guides, reviews, and
  procedural instructions (like installs, deployment steps, etc.).
- The **projects** directory contains information and resources for class
  projects.

#### What can I do?

As a student, you have **pull** permissions on this repository. We recommend
creating a "fork" on GitHub that is your own, so that you can also "push" to it.
You should copy ("clone") your fork to your computer, and add a link to the
original version owned by the instructors.

After that, you can get all of the updates in the online repository from the
instructors, work on it on your computer, and back up and share your work on
your own online copy! We will go over this process (or "workflow") in class.

The biggest rule is this: do not work in any folders (or make changes to any
folders) named `instructor`. If at any time you see `instructor` in the path,
don't make changes! Copy from those files in to your current working folder
(either outside of your repo, or in the current week/day folder). That way
the instructors won't erase or overwrite any of your work!

#### What am I viewing here?

You are viewing the README.md file in the current directory. It is written in
[Markdown] [1] -- a plain text formatting syntax which emphasizes readability.
It is highly recommended that you always have a README.md in the root directory of
your GitHub project. Communication is vital to a developer's work. For viewing and editing Markdown files on your
computer, try [Atom] [2].
