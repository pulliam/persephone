# Project One - Scrum Groups

Every morning at 9 AM for the duration of this project, you'll be meeting with your standup group to briefly discuss your progress. One member of the group will act as the "scribe" each morning, writing each member's responses to the following questions on the whiteboard.

**Yesterday:** What did you work on/get done/struggle with yesterday?

**Today:** What do you plan to accomplish by the end of today?

**Blockers:** What's keeping you from getting the things you need to accomplish done?

Each group is assigned a member of the instructional team. Once everyone has shared, flag down your instructor to recap.
