# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #1: The Game

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative** and work through some really **tough programming challenges** – since you've already gotten your feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

### Objectives

-  Manage yourself (your time and your emotions) when given a large amount of unstructured work.
-  Gain experience building a more complex application.
-  Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate manner.
-  Learn new technologies by reading documentation and experimenting.

### Technical Requirements

Your app **must**:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Contain logic to check for wins, losses, and/or ties**
* **Visually display game state to the user**
* Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**.
* **Be hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**, where the rest of the world can access it.

Your app **should**:

* Contain [valid HTML](https://validator.w3.org/)
* Contain linted JavaScript via [JSHint](http://jshint.com/)
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Maintain consistency within your code - for example, when using vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the DOM or jQuery, stick to one or the other. Don't mix and match.
* Not ["smell"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell), or contain useless commented-out pieces of code.
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
* Adhere to the [student style guide](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-persephone/blob/master/guides/mini_style_guide.md).

### Necessary Deliverables


See [Grading Rubric](./01_project_rubric.md) for additional details.

* A **git repository hosted on Github** with all of your instructors added as collaborators
* A **working game, built by you**, hosted on Github Pages
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A ** `readme.md` file**
* A **5 minute lightning talk**

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down**
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, debugger, etc.) to debug and solve problems.
* Don't forget to ask for help. We're looking forward to your Github issues!
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

### Project Prompts

For each of these prompts, you are responsible for defining what your "MVP", or Minimum Viable Product will be. Your MVP includes the **core features** that will allow your product to be deployed, and no more. For example, win/loss logic would be considered part of your MVP - super sweet animations, however, are not a core feature.

***Keep your time constraints for this project sprint in mind.*** A sprint, in Agile software development, is a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review. Make sure your goals for this sprint are reasonable.

##### [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack)

Make a one player game where people down on their luck can lose all their money by guessing which card the computer will deal next!

##### [Concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game))

Sometimes just called "Memory", it's a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. If you get all the matching cards, you've won!

##### [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)#Gameplay)

A game with 4 colored "buttons". In this game, a round consists of lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

### Daily Structure

* *StandUps* - Students will meet every morning at 9:00 AM for a quick timeboxed ['stand up'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) with their [group](./01_standup_groups.md). A 'stand up' is brief meeting in which each team member talks about what they've accomplished since the last stand up, what they plan to work on until the next stand up and any impediments. This is a chance to ask for help or guidance.

* *Campus* - Although we will not be holding class, we still expect you to be here during project days. You will have full use of our room to work, as well as the rest of the campus.

* *Lightning Talks* - On the morning of Tuesday 11/10, **everyone** will present a time-boxed 5 minute [lightning talk] to our the class about their project's progress.

### Asking For Help

Throughout this sprint, you'll be interacting with each instructor in a variety of ways. You'll have one dedicated pairing session with an instructor on either Friday or Monday - this is a good time to come with a user story you're working on and work on problem solving together. 

Outside of the 1-on-1 pairing session, face-to-face questioning with instructors will be discouraged. Instead, you'll be asked to write a Github issue.

We will look for the following in your issue description:

* What feature are you working on?
* If you are encountering a technical difficulty:
    * What error are you getting?
    * What have you attempted to fix your error?
    * A link to a line number in your application code and/or a code snippet where you think the error is occurring.
* If it is a conceptual or architectural issue:
    * Describe the conundrum
    * Explain the possible paths you have explored

Make sure **your instructors are added** to your project as a collaborator AND that you **assign one of them** to an issue after creating it. If you don't do this we will have no idea that you have a problem :(

First, ***we will ask you to re-write your issue*** if it does not meet the above requirements.

Second, we will do our best to answer you (either in person or online), but it may take us some time to get to your question so if you are truly "stuck," you should find a way to put that feature on hold and work on another feature.

### Useful Resources

* **[MDN Javascript Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** _(a great reference for all things Vanilla Javascript)_
* **[jQuery Docs](http://api.jquery.com)** _(if you're using jQuery)_
* **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)** _(for hosting your game)_
