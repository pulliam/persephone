# Attendance Tracker

Track students' attendance through their course.

### Instructor Portal

An instructor may log in and view a daily roster of their class. They should be able to mark every student as Present, Late, Unexcused Absence or Excused Absence.

An instructor may view previous days' attendance records and the overall student data.

### Student Portal

A student may log in and view their attendance record.

As a student accrues lates and absences, 4 lates will equal one absence. After 4 absences their page should display a notification that they need to contact their course producer with a link to email the producer.

In addition, they should receive an email or text notifying them of their status and encouraging them to contact their instructional team.

### The Producer Portal

A course producer may run several WDIs.  When they log into the Producer Portal they should be able to see a list of the classes they're producing.

A producer should be able to view the attendance records for each class and a list of any students they may need to contact.

### Running Late

A student may text a mobile number to alert their instructors that they are running late. This will be registered as a "lateness".

A student may text a mobile number to alert their instructors that they'll be out sick. This will be registered as an "excused absense".

### The Signup process

When an instructor creates a new cohort through the app, each student should receive an email with a link back to the app for them to either sign up or login. (If they've already taken a class at GA, they should be able to log in with the same account).
