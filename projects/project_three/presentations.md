### How you'll present:

Project presentations are your opportunity to get up in front of your peers and articulate your vision for your project, as well as the snags you encountered and the solutions you devised while developing. This will be fantastic preparation for your job search and careers in development, so look forward to it!

### Group Project Requirements

- Each member of the team must talk.
- Your team must provide an overview of the project
- Give a brief demo (~2-3 minutes)

### Lightning Talk Breakdown

#### Overview & Demo (~5 minutes)

- What does your app **do?**
- Demonstrate the core functionality of your app (what makes it unique - hint: it's not that you can log in).
- Talk about how your team worked together.
- Groups must explain their [Github "Pulse"](https://help.github.com/articles/about-repository-graphs/) as it relates to their group's time management and team member contributions.

#### Deep Dive (~5 minutes)

During this time, you'll be talking about your code in-depth and explaining how you solved challenging problems.

- What you are you proud of, technically speaking?
- What was a difficulty you ran into?
- What would you do differently if you had to start over?
- What feature(s) would you like to build out next?

#### Q&A (~2-3 minutes)

The floor is open for questions from your peers! During this time, your classmates will be asking you to explain your concepts, process, code, and workflow.

- Each student will receive a random question card before presentations begin.
- It's up to each student to use their question card during their classmates' presentations.
- Any un-asked question cards will count against that student's group, so make sure you participate in the discussion!
