## Outline

**Goal: Work TOGETHER to build a complex full stack application**

#### Important Dates

| Date | Milestone |
|:----:|:----------|
| Weds, Dec. 16 | Project Begins |
| Dec. 16 -<br> Dec 18 | Daily Morning Lessons<br>Standup Group Meetings<br>Instructor Check-ins<br>Instructors available via *Github Issues* |

| Mon, Dec. 22<br> 10 PM | **Code freeze!** <br> Get some sleep and get ready to present your project with your team |
| Tues, Dec. 22<br> 9 AM | Project Presentations |

#### Daily Structure

The dedicated project period is known as a ***sprint***. The purpose of the sprint is to fulfill a set of required features known as an ***MVP***, or *minimum viable product*.

**The end of the sprint is not the end of the project**. The resulting application will be a possible portfolio piece, and as such it would behoove us to continue to work on it in the months to come.

During the first three days of the sprint, a **morning lesson will be presented daily at 9 AM**. This lesson will cover important topics that will help you as you progress on the project.

Each group will be assigned an instructor. **Each day, the group will have one meeting with their instructor** to discuss their progress.

**Each group will be responsible for their own project**. This means that every student in the group must be able to explain what every piece of code does. Do not include code which you do not understand!

## Objectives

- Collaborate with your peers as a team.
- Pull everything together by building a more complex web application from the ground up.
- Gain experience collaborating and working in a development team.
- Practice integrating topics covered during this course thus far.
- Use GitHub and [Trello](http://trello.com) to collaborate.

## Requirements

- A Ruby on Rails and Postgres Application.
- An external API must be consumed.
- All of your routes should follow REST protocol
- You application must provide authentication.
- Your application MUST be on Heroku.
- Every team member must be involved.

## The Prompts

For the group project, it's only fitting that you'll be creating something that will benefit your entire class - some sweet classroom management tools! Your group has been assigned the task of creating one of the prompts below. Feel free to choose a killer name for your group.

## Homework for tonight!

# Read?!

Before you start your project sprints have a read through the following documents and discuss your thoughts with your team.

ThoughtBot is a Dev Shop based in Boston. They have an [extensive playbook](https://playbook.thoughtbot.com/) about how they work which is great and very informative.

Working in teams will result in more merge conflicts! Read through the following [Github article on merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/) to prepare yourselves!

Here's an article on several models for Git workflows for teams.

We've been using a feature branch model for our Git workflow. [This article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow) explains several other models.
