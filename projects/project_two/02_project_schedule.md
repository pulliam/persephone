![runrunrun](http://sparkaction.org/sites/sparkaction.org/files/image/fromthefield/x-run.jpg)

#### *Second Project Sprint*

### Starting at 9 AM:

1. Get into your scrum groups - you'll be practicing giving your lightning talks before you present to the class. Criteria for your lightning talk:
    - Should demonstrate user login.
    - Should demonstrate the CREATE feature for one of your resources.
    - Should be 5 minutes in length.
    - Talk about a feature or accomplishment you're proud of or a challenge you overcame.
- Make sure your app is deployed on Heroku and that you have a [completed README](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-persephone/blob/master/projects/project_two/02_project_rubric.md#documentation-3-points) in your repo. We'll be presenting from a shared laptop, so you'll be showing your deployed app.
- ***Share a link in the WDI Persephone Slack chat to your deployed app before 9:30 AM!***

### Lighting Talks

- Quick Demo
- What was a challenge?
