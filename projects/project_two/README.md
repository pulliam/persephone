# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a larger-scale, full-stack application.** You'll be **building a Sinatra app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It's a lot, but you've been given the tools over the past few weeks to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. While we hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, there are a few guidelines. You'll need to sketch some wireframes before you start and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

### Timeframe

Project kickoff is Wednesday, December 2nd, and last day for development is Monday, December 7th. There will be a **code freeze** at 10 PM on 12/7! We will be demoing our deployed applications on Tuesday, December 8th.

### Technologies

You will be expected to use the following technologies to implement this project. For more details, please review the [project two rubric](./02_project_rubric.md).

- **HTML**  
  Your HTML should be valid according to the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

- **CSS**  
  Your app should be styled using valid, well-formatted CSS.

- **Ruby & Sinatra**  
  Your app will need to have its own server.

- **SQL/ActiveRecord**  
  Your app will need to persist data using a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System). You will also use ActiveRecord as an ORM.

- **JavaScript/jQuery**  
  Your app should use jQuery to enhance user interactions (think animations, validating forms, showing/hiding information, modals, etc.).

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (more if they make sense) – One representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE
* **Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure** and interact with your relationally-stored data
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted online
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere ([imgur](http://imgur.com/), perhaps?) & embedded in your readme
* A section in your ``readme.md`` for the **user stories you created**

### How to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems.**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Sometimes, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always (and it's not always a good tutorial). **Learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.**
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _todo lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of how something works helps.
