## Overview of `Wiki.app`

Henrietta is a business magnate and wants to create a internally facing wiki for her organization. She wants her employees to be able to write articles in order to inform colleagues about their insights.

## Project Details

### What is a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)?

### Necessary features

A basic implementation of this project must include:

1. A user should be able to create and edit articles.
1. A user should be able to see all articles that currently exist.
1. All articles should be editable - this is a collaborative workplace!
1. All articles should display an author so that anyone who has questions about the contents of an article can contact the author.
1. If an article is changed, the time of that change should be shown so that users can know how up to date an article is.
1. Henrietta wants the articles to be written in markdown so that the content is visually appealing.
1. Henrietta wants users to be able to add a category to an article so that articles can be organized.

###  Advanced features

Going above and beyond the basic implementation is desirable, should you have the time.  Feel free to enhance your project with any of the following features:

1. Implement a search feature! Allow users to search your articles for content.

1. Henrietta would love the articles to be printable! The print version should be nicely formatted only showing the content. (CSS: media queries)

1. Henrietta thinks old changes should persist, rather than be overwritten, so you can see old versions of the article.

1. She would like users to be able to comment on changes, so they can discuss the pros and cons of a change.

1. In order to keep users engaged, Henrietta would like a user to receive an email when an article that they've published is edited.

1. EXTRA FANCY She would like changes to be ratified before becoming the default article. The newest change with 80% approval is the current article version.

Disavowing pizza and red bull, the stereotypical food choice of developers, you have decided to explore New York City's salad offerings.

- While at Chopt, you overheard two developers chatting about how  [redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) is a great Ruby gem for rendering markdown.
