## CSS & Aesthetics (3 Points)

- Proper use of CSS - Your CSS does not appear to be "broken" (elements positioned incorrectly, off-screen, etc).

Deployed and accessible online. (Expect a Morning Exercise on Deployment during project days)

## Presentation (3 Points)

### Full "Meets Expectations" Score: <u>30 Points</u><br>Maximum Score: <u>42 Points</u>
##### *With 3 Point Bonus: 45*

**Note:** A "perfect score" on this project *does not exist.* Your goal for this project should be to improve on your current level of skill, try something new, and create something you can be proud of having worked on! The purpose of this numeric break down is to help you to assess your strengths and weaknesses and to help guide you in your future growth. We hope you'll use this rubric to help you figure out where you can improve and where you excel!

## A Note on Plagiarism
Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for expulsion.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and StackOverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

If you use outside libraries or code snippets, be sure to attribute them in your code and/or in your README.
