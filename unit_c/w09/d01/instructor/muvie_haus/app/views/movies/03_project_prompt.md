# Project Three

![](proj_3_img/teamwork.jpg)

**<span style="color:darkblue">Build a complex full stack application </span>**

This application will:

1. Use Ruby on Rails a framework
1. Incorporate server-side rendering through the use of ERB templates
1. Persist data to a PostgreSql server using the ActiveRecord ORM
1. Include the use of an external API

**Each group will be responsible for their own project**. This means that every student in the group must be able to explain what every piece of code does. Do not include code which you do not understand!
