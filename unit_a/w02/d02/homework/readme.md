# Redux!

Tonight's homework is going to be a second pass.


## First 

Read through the style guide Sung posted yesterday.  
Take a look in the [mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQQtfUsxoE4) and ask yourself "Did I indent my code to the best of my ability?"

## Second

Return to the [Relaxr Morning Exercise](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-persephone/tree/master/unit_a/w02/d02/morning-exercise) and practice translating the mock up into HTML and CSS.

Things to consider...

- How does the mockup translate to the box model?
- How many rectangles are on the page?
- What looks like it displays inline? 
- What displays block?  
- How you would label and refer to each part of the page?
- What class names and IDs would communicate to both designers and non-techtypes?

## Second

Return to [Middle Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVA1ygGA1b0)!  

Take another pass at writing functions to construct and manipulate parts of the DOM.

Can you apply any of today's [Homework Takeaways](https://goo.gl/iT8BL6)? 

If you haven't already complete up to Part 5.

## Third!

LOTR AUTOPLAY!

Can you apply today's [`window.setTimeout`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri6o8cU3QpI&list=RDri6o8cU3QpI#t=0) to make each function run one after the other? 

Use several `window.setTimeout`s and space each function out by 2 seconds. 

## Bonus

Relaxr has several different "sections" of variable heights. Can you use JavaScript to make each section the same height as the window?
