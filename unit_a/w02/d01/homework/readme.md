# Fellowship of the Ring DOM Manipulation

![:image](http://static2.fjcdn.com/comments/Already+sick+of+seeing+this+bitches+unintelligent+looking+face+_9fb6934e187f1ab6ff74ff1fd7d83f6a.jpg)

## Introduction

To practice manipulating the DOM, we've provided you with a series of steps in a `.js` file.  Create a function for each of the steps to practice DOM Manipulation and JavaScript. These should each be called in order after the window has loaded.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Open the `/fellowships.js`. This is where you will work. Define and invoke the functions outlined as comments.
- There are 12 steps in total.  Try to get through at least the first five.

**Bonus:**

- Within the click event listener for clicking `'#the-ring'`, add functionality so that when it's clicked, it not only calls `nazgulScreech` but also causes Frodo's opacity to go down to 0 for 1 second and then to fade back in.
- If the ring is clicked three times, the entire body element should disappear, to be replaced with the text "The Ring has been returned to Sauron and the world is over."

#### Deliverable

Your solution should look a little something like this:
