# Instagram Markup

Today we've got a new client job from a young start up called Instagram.  They're offering to pay us in stock options. Should we take them or demand hard cash??

## Part 1 - HTML

The copy has already been placed in instagram.html. 

Train your eye to how many rectangles there are. 
What are good names for the secions of the page?

## Part 2 - Styling

It looks like we may have two containers next to eachother. 
We might not know how to do that yet, so concentrate first on styling them separately.
Imagine they're just stacked on top of eachother as separate divs.

Then take a look at floats.html and see how the browser renders it. How does it accomplish two columns?

Read through MDNs's documentation for [CSS floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float) and [clear](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clear)

All of the necessary assets are included in the `/images` folder.
