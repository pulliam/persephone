### 1. Calculator

1. ***Step one:*** Build a calculator using two inputs and a button. Your calculator should take two **numbers** and **add** them together. After the numbers are added together, your page should then *show the result* of that operation to the user. Display a history of past answers.
- ***Step two:*** Add another input that allows the user to **enter an operation** (-, +, x, \) and then compute the result of that operation and show it to the user.

### 2. To Do List

1. ***Step One:*** Create another page with an input and a button. Then add a header that contains the text "To-Do List" and an empty ordered list beneath it.
- ***Step Two:*** When the user enters text and clicks the submit button, append the text they entered as a new `li` element inside of the `ul` you created.
- ***Step Three:*** When a user clicks on a to-do item, make the item appear to have been [crossed out](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration).
- ***Bonus:*** Get rid of your **submit** button! Modify your code so that the user only needs to press "Enter" to add their to-do item.
- ***Bonus Two:*** When a new item is added, include an "edit" button inside your `li` element.
  - This button, when clicked, should make a new input element appear below your li's text. The user should be able to enter new text that will replace the current text of the li. 

### Bonus

1. Select Me! Update your calculator inputs to use a [select element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) for your operations.
1. Let's time our tasks!  Try updating your Todo App so that each Todo item can have a "due-in" input so we can set timers.
