# jQuery-fy it!

Welcome to your jQuery playground! CSS and HTML have been provided for you. Your job: Complete as many of the challenges below using jQuery as you can.

### Challenge One: Welcome to the Challenge

- Get animated! When your user loads up the page, the text inside your header should animate in, step-by-step (first the h1, then the h2, then the p tag). Feel free to use Animate.css classes to spice up your animation.

### Challenge Two: The Drinking Game

Your client is a health and fitness tracking website! They want their customers to be able to track the number of glasses of water they drink per day.

- When the user clicks the "Add Water" button, increase the amount of water in the glass. According to the ruler next to it, 1 inch = 1 glass drunk.
- Update the counter below the ruler to show how many glasses of water the user has drunk.
- Prevent the user from adding more than 8 glasses of water.
- Now add functionality to your "Remove Water" and "Empty Glass" buttons! These should subtract glasses of water and reset the counter.

### Challenge Three: Pop-Over

Your client wants to promote their latest health product - BARBELLS! The ad div has an id of "pop-over". They'd like the ad to appear to "slide in" from the right 5 seconds after the user has loaded the page, then stay in the lower right-hand corner of the screen until the user clicks it.

- Make sure the div is hidden until 5 seconds after the page loads.
- Use jQuery to change the CSS of your ad's div. What kind of positioning might you use?
- Now animate your div! There are many ways to do this - consider using [jQuery's .animate() method](http://api.jquery.com/animate/), or the [CSS transition property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions).
