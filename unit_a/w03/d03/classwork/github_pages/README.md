### Introduction

Today will be a day full of exploration, wonder, and excitement - you'll be deploying your code online for the first time! At the end of this exercise, you'll be able to view your **Tic-Tac-Toe** project live on the web.

### Github Pages

So far in class, we've been using git to push our code to our Github repositories so that we can view, back up, and share our code online. **[Github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)** are simple, public webpages hosted by Github that serve up the code in your repository on the web.

#### Examples

- [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
- [Twitter](http://twitter.github.io/)
- [Headsmart](http://cameronmcefee.github.io/headsmart/)

### Your Mission

Today, you'll be creating a new Github repository that will contain your **Tic-Tac-Toe project code**. You'll be researching how to make the website you developed locally available on the web using Github Pages.

#### Things you already know:

- How to create a new Github repository and clone it down onto your computer
- How to add, commit, and push code from your local machine to your remote repo

#### Things you'll need to research

- How Github Pages works
  - **[Github Help for GH Pages]((https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)**
  - **[Github's Walkthrough](https://pages.github.com/#vanilla-step-1)** ***IMPORTANT:*** You should be creating a **Project Site** for this part of the exercise, *not* a **User or Organization Site**. Also, you'll be "starting from scratch."
  - Note: You'll be creating your page manually, not using a template.

### Deliverables

- A user should be able to navigate to `YOURGHUSERNAME.github.io/YOURREPONAME` and be able to play your tic-tac-toe game!

## Consider This:

> How does/should your deployed tic-tac-toe code differ from your WDI repo?

## Go Further:

- Create a **User or Organization Site** that will serve as your portfolio page. It should include:
  - Your name and location
  - Include a link to your tic tac toe project.

`"Hello my name is Edward"`

`"I'm a web developer living in NYC"`

`"`[`Play Tic-Tac-Toe Here`]()`"`

> Has anyone made tick taco tao?
