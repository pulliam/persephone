## WDI Pick-Me-Up

You have been tasked with creating your own version of [Emergency Compliment](http://emergencycompliment.com/), except with  WDI-themed compliments. When a user visits the site, they should be greeted with a WDI-themed compliment to cheer them up.

#### Part 1: Setup

When you visit the webpage, it should display:
- a generic greeting
- a randomly chosen compliment (sample comments below)
- a button that says `"I'm still emotionally vacant. Give me another compliment."` and replaces the current compliment with another one.
- another button that says `"I'm ready to soldier on."` and takes the user to the jQuery docs when clicked.

Some sample compliments

```javascript
var compliments = [
  'People behind you in class think you are the perfect height.',
  'Your posture during breaks effectively masks your exhaustion.',
  'Your commit messages are Kafka-esque.',
  'Your fingers are magic on the keys.'
];
```

#### Part 2: Randomize Background Color

Make it so that anytime a new compliment is shown, the background color changes.

#### Part 3: Make It Look Good

Style really hard with CSS.
