# Project One Sprint Wrap-up

### *Congratulations on making it through Project One!*

We've spent the first few weeks of the course learning how to write JavaScript that performs logic in the **client** and allows us to interact programmatically with our HTML documents. Next, we're going to begin learning **Ruby**, a programming language that will enable us to write **servers**. We'll also be teaching you how the Internet works - how clients and servers interact via **requests** and **responses**.

### Right Now: Ask Yourself...

If you were going to learn a new programming language, what questions would you have? You've already learned one programming language, and you're about to learn another! Think about the things you now know how to do in JavaScript. With this knowledge, consider what you might want to know about Ruby. Take one minute by yourself right now, then two minutes with a partner - write down three questions that you have about this new language.

#### Examples:

- How do I define a variable in Ruby? Is it different than in JavaScript?
- Where do I go for information about Ruby? What kind of documentation exists for it?
- Does Ruby have functions?

### Tonight: Explore

We strongly suggest reading over [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://poignant.guide/).

If you're interested in exploring further, you may also find the first few levels of [Codecademy's Ruby course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby) a useful introduction to the language.

Most importantly, come to class on Thursday full of thoughtful questions and curiosity!
