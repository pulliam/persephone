### Github Issue Help Request Guide

If you have questions or are stuck on a homework (or project) feel free to submit a github issue to us. It is expected that you "rubber duck" your problem or seek out other resources before presenting the issue.

**How to submit an issue**

* Go to ga-students/wdi-persephone repo
* Click on the "issues" tab on the right hand side
* Click on the green "New Issue" button
* Add the **help wanted** label.
* In the **title** include:
    * 1) your name
    * 2) the week/day of the homework assignment
    * 3) "HW Help Request"

* Inside the **body**:
    * Provide a link to your homework on github.
        * Provide a link to the source of the error (File and Line Number) if possible.
    * Describe what you are trying to accomplish. What part of the homework are you working on?
    * What do you expect to happen?
    * What is actually happening?
    * What error are you getting, if any?
    * What have you attempted to fix your error?
    * A copy of the error message and [stack trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace).
    * Snippet of the most likely source of your error/bug.

* If it is a conceptual or architectural issue:
    * Describe the conundrum.
    * Explain the possible paths you have explored.


    **We aren't mind readers. Give as much relevant information as possible.**


**Notes:**

First, we will ask you to re-write your issue if it does not contain enough information as per the requirements above.

Second, we will do our best to answer you (either in person or online), but it may take us some time to get to your question, so if you are truly 'stuck' you should find a way to put that task on hold and work on another task.

**Remember that [rubber ducks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and classmates are also excellent resources.**
