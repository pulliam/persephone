## Post-Class Workflow

Sadly, we've wrapped up our time together as a class, and thus your learning process going forward will be mostly self-directed. To help focus your time, we've put together this guide on how to best approach your development post-course.

#### Use Your Self-Assessments

Your self-assessments are an invaluable tool. Review them on a regular basis and chip away at all the stuff you are even remotely unsure of. Test your mental models! Provided you're honest with yourself, it will give you the best measuring stick of your understanding and progress.

#### WRITE CODE

* Build out your old projects and start new ones. There's no better way to learn than to build.
* Try tackling a different project prompt. 
* Build a clone of a well-known site.
* Fork open source projects on GitHub and submit fixes to issues.
* Make it a goal to open your terminal every day. We've learned an incredible about over the past 3 months, and most likely you're tired. But it is critical that you continue to utitilize the skills you learned because you will forget what you've learned if you don't keep at it. So keep at it.

#### SCRUM with each other at GA

* Self-organize into groups and agree on a time to meet at GA or elsewhere.
* Spend 5-10 minutes each day to:
  * Review what you accomplished the day before
  * Plan what you are going to tackle that day, however big or small.
  * Identify anything that might be blocking you and figure out what needs to happen to remove those blockers

#### Attend Meetups

Identify common areas of interest (gaming, education, healthcare, et cetera) among your classmates, and use Slack to alert them to meetups you plan on attending. Trust us, it's always easier to go with a group than alone. Fer sher.
